obj_refs(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object}
}
\description{
This is a R wrapper to the C-level \code{NAMED()} macro, which estimates how
many references (names) a value has.
}
\examples{
# An expression has a ref count of 0 because it's never assigned
# a name
obj_refs(1:10)

# The RStudio environment pane takes a reference to objects.
# In the console, this will return 1, in RStudio 2.
x <- 1:10
obj_refs(x)

f <- function() {
  x <- 1:10
  obj_refs(x)
}
f()

x <- 1:10
y <- x
obj_refs(x)
z <- x
# R can count references to a maximum of 2
# which also means that a count of two can never be decremented
rm(x, y)
obj_refs(z)
}
