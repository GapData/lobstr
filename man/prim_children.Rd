\title{Primitive children.}
\usage{
prim_children(x)

user_children(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments pass to \code{user_children} methods.}
}
\value{
A list of children with class "primlist". This list should be
  considered read-only. DO NOT modify any elements returned by this
  function.
}
\description{
Extract all the low-level children of an element. This works at a low-level:
all dispatch is done in C on the SEXPTYPE. No S3 dispatch is performed. The
result has an \code{$} method defined so you can interactively drill down.
}
\examples{
prim_children(mtcars)
prim_children(mtcars)$`__attributes`
prim_children(list(1:10, runif(1e3)))
}
