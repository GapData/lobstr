\title{Call stack tree}
\usage{
cst()
}
\description{
Shows the relationship between calls on the stack
}
\examples{
# If all evaluation is eager, you get a single tree
f <- function() g()
g <- function() h()
h <- function() cst()
f()

# You get multiple trees with delayed evaluation enters
try(f())

# Pay attention to the first element of each subtree: each
# evaluates the outermost call
f <- function(x) g(x)
g <- function(x) h(x)
h <- function(x) x
try(f(cst()))

# You can also get unusual trees by evaluating in frames
# higher up the call stack
f <- function() g()
g <- function() h()
h <- function() eval(quote(cst()), parent.frame(2))
f()
}
